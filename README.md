## How-To Guide

This is a simple plugin that allows you to manage warranties for your products. The plugin uses a [one-to-one](https://developer.shopware.com/docs/guides/plugins/plugins/framework/data-handling/add-data-associations.html#one-to-one-associations) relationship in the [ProductWarrantyDefinition](https://github.com/pedramham/shopware-warranty-manager/blob/master/src/Content/ProductWarranty/ProductWarrantyDefinition.php) class, but you can adjust it to use a many-to-many relationship if needed.

The [sas_warranty_manager_product](https://github.com/pedramham/shopware-warranty-manager/blob/master/src/Migration/Migration1697208982ProductWarranty.php) table has two fields: `warrantyDuration` and `warrantyText` for manage warranty. You can add more fields such as `image`, `icon`, `price`, etc. if needed.

According to the Shopware core codes, I used the [ImportExportFactoryDecorator](https://github.com/pedramham/shopware-warranty-manager/blob/master/src/Content/Decorator/ImportExportFactoryDecorator.php) decorator. The [WarrantyManager](https://github.com/pedramham/shopware-warranty-manager/blob/master/src/Content/Decorator/WarrantyManager.php) class gets a CSV file from the administration panel and uses the [makeWarrantiesArray](https://github.com/pedramham/shopware-warranty-manager/blob/master/src/Content/Decorator/WarrantyManager.php#L219) method to create an array.
The [ImportWarrantyService](https://github.com/pedramham/shopware-warranty-manager/blob/master/src/Service/ImportWarrantyService.php) class is then used to import the data into the database. If you add more fields, you can adjust the [ImportWarrantyService](https://github.com/pedramham/shopware-warranty-manager/blob/master/src/Service/ImportWarrantyService.php#L30) class accordingly.
